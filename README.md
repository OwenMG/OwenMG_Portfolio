# OwenMG_Portfolio
This project, the second homework in the BCS Bootcamp, was to create a portfolio website from scratch.

I first created a basic html skeleton and used the internet to find a color palette.

I filled the skeleton with the content that would be used on the page, initially using place holders such as lorem ipsum...

I then created a reset.css page and a style.css page, and used the style page to set the basic stylings like font and colors.

Following along with the readme, I implemented some interactivity and reactivity, as well as added a few more styling choices. 

All images and project links are currently placeholders, to be updated with live project links as my actual portfolio grows (along with quite a bit more beautification!)
